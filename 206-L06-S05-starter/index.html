          <h2>About me!</h2>
          <p><strong>Hi, I'm Victoria Smith.</strong> I absolutely adore learning and researching about 
            various topics, from cooking to technology. I am a VERY detail-oriented person, enjoy problem 
            solving and looking at things from various angles. I also enjoy streamlining problems into 
            simpler, easier to understand concepts. I prefer to use my skills to assist others in any way 
            possible, whether itâ€™s fashion advice or assisting our dear elderly ones in learning how to 
            use their electronic devices. I decided to go into the tech field because I have multiple 
            relatives who have experience in this line of work and I always found it intriguing. I enjoy 
            seeing the fast-paced advances in technology and thoroughly enjoy the fact that in order to progress, 
            one must learn new concepts on a continual basis. I believe my endless hunger for knowledge will 
            be a huge positive in my journey to becoming a full-stack developer.</p>
